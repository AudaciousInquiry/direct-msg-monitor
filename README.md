# direct-msg-monitor
The message monitoring module is aggregating tracked message in a HISP and determining if failure notification messages need to be sent to a message originator based on specific conditions. The default implementation of this module implements a generic condition algorithm for messages that do not conform to the [implementation guide](http://wiki.directproject.org/w/images/a/a1/Implementation_Guide_for_Delivery_Notification_in_Direct_v1.0.pdf) for delivery notification of the Direct Project. It also implements the monitoring conditions as specified by the the reliable and timely messaging implementation guidance of the Direct Project.
